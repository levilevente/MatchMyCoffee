This directory contains the user interface for **MatchMyCoffee**. It is a modern Single Page Application (SPA) serving three main audiences:

1.  **Customers:** Webshop, Taste Profile Questionnaire, and Ordering.
2.  **Admins:** Product management and user moderation.
3.  **Marketing:** Blog and content management.

## 🏗 Architecture

The frontend is built as a standalone React application using **Vite** for fast development and bundling. It is designed to consume APIs from:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot (User data, Products, Orders)
- **AI Agent:** Python/LangGraph (Recommendations, Intelligent Chat)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v20.19.0
- **Yarn:** This project uses Yarn for dependency management.

### Installation

Navigate to the frontend directory (if you are at the repo root):

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

### Running Locally

Start the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

Note: This command runs the Frontend only. If you need to interact with real data (Coffees, Orders) or the AI Agent, ensure the Spring Boot and Python services are running. Refer to the Root README for full stack orchestration.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn dev` - Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
- `yarn build` - Compiles the application for production into the dist/ folder.
- `yarn preview` - Locally previews the production build generated by yarn build.
- `yarn lint` - Runs ESLint to check for code quality, hooks usage, and accessibility.
- `yarn lint:fix` - Runs ESLint and attempts to auto-fix simple issues.
- `yarn format` - Formats all supported files using Prettier.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized to support the distinct areas of the platform (Webshop, Admin, and Taste Profile).

```

## 🛠 Code Quality & Configuration

To ensure a bug-free and consistent codebase for developers, we enforce strict static analysis: - **ESLint:** configured in `eslint.config.mjs`. It enforces React best practices, Accessibility (a11y) standards, and Import sorting. - **Prettier:** It ensures that indentation, quotes, and spacing are identical regardless of the developer's machine.

### Recomended Workflow

1. Install the ESLint and Prettier extensions in VS Code.
2. Enable "Format on Save" in your editor settings.
3. Run yarn lint before pushing any code.

## CI/CD

This directory is monitored by the repository's GitHub Actions workflow. On every Pull Request affecting `frontend/**`:

1. Dependencies are installed via `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Linting checks are run to prevent bad patterns.
3. Formatting checks ensure style compliance.
4. Build verification runs to ensure the app compiles without TypeScript errors.
